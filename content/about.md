# The Starred PH

Top 10 most starred Github repositories initiated by developers located in the Philippines

## Context

In the ever growing horizon of people and set of technologies available in the development bubble nowadays. For filipino rookies, it is kind of challenging to find inspirations in which they could delve in to.

The project aims to be a station for fellow pinoy developers and their projects to be promoted, so that others may see it as well. And for starters, who might be curious of what other tech craftsmen do at their spare time and what frameworks do they use.

## Inspirations

This project is inspired by the following existing projects:

- [Github Ranking](https://github.com/EvanLi/Github-Ranking) - a list of the most github stars and forks repositories.
- [Commit Tops](https://github.com/lauripiispanen/most-active-github-users-counter) - a CLI tool that queries the GitHub GraphQL API for users and ranks them according to number of contributions.

## How is the list being generated?

1. Fetch 100 most followed Github users with "Philippines" indicated in their location.
2. Users must have at least 10 followers.
3. List their top 10 repos based on stargazers count. (The project limits the list in to top 10 repositories only, and a user may have the top 10 most starred repository)
4. Repository must be public, must be originally owned by the user and is not forked.
5. Do steps 1 to 4 but with users with "PH" indicated in their location.
6. Merge all collected repos and sort it from highest stargazer count, and get the top 10.

## Contribute

This project is open for contribution.
